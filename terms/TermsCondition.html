            including without limitation if You breach these Terms and Conditions.</p>
        <p>Upon termination, Your right to use the Service will cease immediately.</p>
        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability of the Company and any of its
            suppliers under
            any provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the
            amount
            actually paid by You through the Service or 100 USD if You haven't purchased anything through the Service.
        </p>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its suppliers be liable
            for any
            special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages
            for loss
            of profits, loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal injury, loss of
            privacy
            arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the Service, third-party software
            and/or
            third-party hardware used with the Service, or otherwise in connection with any provision of this Terms),
            even if
            the Company or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails
            of its
            essential purpose.</p>
        <p>Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or
            consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states, each
            party's
            liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>
        <h2>&quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>The Service is provided to You &quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; and with all faults and defects
            without
            warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own behalf
            and on
            behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims
            all
            warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service, including all
            implied
            warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement, and warranties
            that may
            arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the
            foregoing,
            the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the Service
            will meet
            Your requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software,
            applications,
            systems or services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be error
            free or
            that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.</p>
        <p>Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the company's provider makes any
            representation or
            warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the Service, or the
            information, content, and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the Service will be
            uninterrupted or
            error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information or content provided
            through the
            Service; or (iv) that the Service, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or on behalf of the
            Company are
            free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components.</p>
        <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable
            statutory
            rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You. But in
            such a
            case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent
            enforceable
            under applicable law.</p>
